Release Notes  -  SABnzbd 2.2.0 Alpha 1
=========================================================

NOTE: Due to changes in this release, the queue will be converted when 2.2.0
is started for the first time. Job order, settings and data will be
preserved, but all jobs will be unpaused and URL's that did not finish
fetching before the upgrade will be lost!

## Changes in 2.2.0
- Reduced memory usage, especially with larger queues
- Slight improvement in download performance by removing internal locks
- Smoother animations in Firefox (disabled previously due to FF high-CPU usage)
- If enabled, replace dots in filenames also when there are spaces already
- Jobs outside server retention are processed faster
- max_art_opt and replace_illegal moved from Switches to Specials

## Bugfixes in 2.2.0
- Shutdown/suspend did not work on some Linux systems
- Deleting a job could result in write errors
- Display warning if custom par2 parameters are wrong
- macOS: Catch 'Protocol wrong type for socket' errors
- Windows: Fix error in MultiPar-code when first par2-file was damaged

## Translations
- Added Hebrew translation by ION IL, many other languages updated.

## Upgrading from 0.7.x and older
- Finish queue
- Stop SABnzbd
- Install new version
- Start SABnzbd

## Upgrade notices (from pre-2.x.x)
- Windows: When starting the Post-Processing script, the path to the job folder
  is no longer in short-path notation but includes the full path. To support
  long paths (>255), you might need to alter them to long-path notation (\\?\).
- Schedule items are converted when upgrading to 2.x.x and will break when
  reverted back to pre-2.x.x releases.
- The organization of the download queue is different from 0.7.x releases.
  So 2.x.x will not see the existing queue, but you can go to Status->Queue Repair
  and "Repair" the old queue.

## Known problems and solutions
- Read the file "ISSUES.txt"
